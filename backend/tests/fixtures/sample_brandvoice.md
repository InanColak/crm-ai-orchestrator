# Acme Corp Brand Voice Guidelines

## Tone of Voice

Our brand voice is **professional yet approachable**. We communicate with confidence without being arrogant. We are experts in our field, but we explain complex concepts in accessible language.

### Key Tone Characteristics:
- **Confident** - We know our value and communicate it clearly
- **Friendly** - We're easy to talk to and genuinely helpful
- **Professional** - We maintain high standards in all communications
- **Human** - We avoid robotic, corporate-speak language

## Writing Style

### Sentence Structure
- Use short, clear sentences
- Active voice preferred over passive voice
- Lead with the most important information
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks

### Formatting
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key terms and important concepts
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Include clear calls-to-action

### Personalization
- Always address the recipient by their first name

## Key Phrases to Use

These phrases embody our brand voice. Include them naturally in communications:

- "Based on my understanding of your business..."
- "I'd love to schedule a quick call to discuss..."
- "Our clients in [industry] have seen..."
